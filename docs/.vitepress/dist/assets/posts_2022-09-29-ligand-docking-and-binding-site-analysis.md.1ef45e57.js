For a thorough understanding of the structural features that determine the strength of bonding between a ligand with its receptor, an insight to visualize binding geometries and interaction is mandatory. Bioinformatical as well as graphical software ‘PyMOL’ in combination with the molecular docking suites Autodock and Vina allows the study of molecular combination to visualize and understand the structurebased drug design efforts. In the present study, we outlined a user friendly method to perform molecular docking using vina and finally the results were analyzed in pymol in both two as well as three-dimensional orientation. The operation bypasses the steps that are involved in docking using cygwin terminal like formation of gpf and dpf files. The simple and straight-forward operation method does not require formal bioinformatics training to apprehend molecular docking studies using AutoDock 4.2 program.</p><p><sup><em><strong>Keywords:</strong> Auto-Dock; Chemdraw; DSV (Discovery Studio Visualizer); PDB (Protein Data Bank) and Pubchem: PYMOL</em></sup></p><h2 id="_1-introduction" tabindex="-1">1. Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In the present era of technology advancement, various operations are performed with the help of computer to increase the reliability, productivity and most importantly the ease of the work. For example, in the field of computer-aided structure-based drug designing, molecular docking has been frequently used to predict the prominent and acknowledged geometry of a protein-ligand complex and to understand the interaction studies of the target with specific ligands. The authentication of docking methodology can be validated by parallel crystallography techniques. In addition, docking is often used in addition with scoring functions to predict binding affinities of ligands in virtual screening experiments (1). It is also important in studying the structure activity relationships in the synthesis of new compounds (2 and 3). The function of docking is to define the energetics of the system and the efficiency of the ligand molecule to bind to its target, as it forms the basis of the docking algorithms attempt. In recent years, the process of virtual screening technique for docking small molecules into a known protein structure is a powerful tool for drug design and has become an integral part of the drug discovery process. Various Computational tools like Auto-Dock are available that offer the advantage of molecular docking at a relatively faster pace (4). Auto-Dock is freely available docking software that employs a Lamarckian type of genetic algorithm for computing ligands with varying conformations and minimization of the scoring function that attributes to its energy. However, the use of Auto-Dock in virtual screening is limited to the chemical compounds whose features can be calculated (5). In the present study, we provide an easier protocol for the molecular docking process using Auto-Dock and Vina. The method was substantiated by taking example of molecular docking of Glucose 6 phosphate isomerase with its ligand Dglucose 6 phosphates.</p><h2 id="_2-methods" tabindex="-1">2.

In the present article, we have tried to decipher docking process in an easier and user-friendly way. Our protocol provides a detailed outline and advice for use of Auto-Dock tool to analyze interaction complexes using computational docking. The example of a docking experiment between Glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (an enzyme) its ligand glucose six phosphates using Auto-Dock 4.2 Vina has been used for better understanding and execution of the program. The approach offers simple and user friendly strategy to study drug/ligand-receptor interaction.</p><h2 id="_4-acknowledgements" tabindex="-1">4.
